We need to choose models and let's look slightly into this task:

Generally, we do not need one model, but several models:
- Offline models work when we are offline, without costs or any implicit restrictions to usage time.
  - Altough they do not restrict you in one way: they do not turn into smaller models or switch off image generation over time ..probably, you can only use small model and setting up image generation is another effort.
- Online models work when we are online: for basic usage, you don't even need to log-in, while for more and more advanced usage you might pay, wait for credits or earn credits somehow; you can lose internet, wait in queue, or run out of something.

In offline models: the biggest good is that you *won't* run out of anything: it continues it's stable, steady and slow go.
- If you are an architect or a builder, they have another one: you can create a sandbox of your surely working condition before you prepare to move onto real platform over time.

## 🌱 Tiny Models — The Smallest Brains With the Biggest Lessons

Tiny models are the **microscopes** of the AI world.  
They are small, fragile, limited — and absolutely fascinating.  
Working with them is a rewarding challenge: if you can make a tiny model answer something useful, you’ve learned more about AI than most people ever will.

Tiny models teach you:
- how models think  
- where they break  
- how formats matter  
- how prompts shape intelligence  
- how platforms influence output  

They are the **sandbox**, the **lab**, and the **training wheels** for understanding everything else in Activity 3.

### 🐣 TinyLlama — The Art of Making a Small Brain Think

TinyLlama (1.1B parameters) is the classic example of a tiny model.  
It’s like trying to have a philosophical conversation with a very smart squirrel:  
possible, but you must ask the *right* questions.

Working with TinyLlama is an **interesting task** and a **worthy reward** because:

- You learn what the model *can* answer  
- You learn what it *cannot* answer  
- You learn how to shape prompts  
- You learn how to configure platforms  
- You learn how to detect nonsense early  
- You learn how to build a stable environment for small intelligence  

Tiny models are honest: they show you the **bare metal** of AI.

### 🔍 What You Must Figure Out With Tiny Models

#### 1. Which questions the model answers well
Tiny models excel at:
- simple definitions  
- short Q&A  
- basic reasoning  
- tiny coding snippets  
- simple math  
- short explanations  

They fail at:
- long context  
- multi‑step reasoning  
- abstract tasks  
- complex instructions  
- multi‑document analysis  

Your job is to **map the model’s comfort zone**.

---

#### 2. Physical qualities: how much they can handle
Every tiny model has physical limits:
- **Max question length** (often 128–512 tokens)  
- **Max trivial complexity** (one or two reasoning steps)  
- **Max output length** (short answers only)  

If you exceed these limits, the model:
- hallucinates  
- loops  
- outputs nonsense  
- stops mid‑sentence  

Learning these limits is part of the craft.

---

#### 3. Metaqualities: what the model *really* is
Tiny models have hidden personalities:

- **Specialization**  
  - Some are better at coding  
  - Some at chat  
  - Some at math  
  - Some at science  

- **Intelligence level**  
  - How many steps of reasoning?  
  - How well does it follow instructions?  
  - Does it understand formatting?  

- **Hidden complexity**  
  - Some tiny models surprise you  
  - Some collapse instantly  

You must discover these qualities through experimentation.

---

#### 4. Format limitations
Tiny models do **not** understand:
- many formats  
- many tags  
- many tool‑use patterns  
- many hidden instructions  

You must figure out:
- which Q&A formats work  
- which prompt shapes produce clarity  
- which platform settings prevent nonsense  
- which tags or markers the model respects  

This is part of building a **stable tiny‑model workflow**.

---

#### 5. Platform compatibility
Tiny models do not run everywhere.

You must test:
- which servers support them (Ollama, GPT4All, LM Studio, llama.cpp)  
- which clients can talk to them  
- which quantizations work  
- which configurations avoid crashes  

Sometimes the model works only on:
- one runtime  
- one quantization  
- one client  

This is normal for tiny models.

---

### 🌍 Ecological and Sustainable Intelligence

Tiny models are:
- extremely energy‑efficient  
- extremely fast  
- extremely cheap  
- extremely stable  

Using them where practical is **ecological** and **sustainable**.  
They are the bicycles of AI: simple, clean, and surprisingly powerful.

---

### 🏋️ Lift Small, Lift Big

If you can lift a tiny model:
- you can lift a medium model  
- you can lift a large model  
- you can lift an online model  

The skills transfer upward.

Tiny models teach you:
- boundaries  
- bottlenecks  
- failure modes  
- reasoning limits  
- context limits  

Everything you learn from tiny models applies to big ones — just scaled up.

---

### 🧪 Tiny Models Are a Lab for Big Models

Tiny models emulate:
- the same bottlenecks  
- the same context issues  
- the same hallucination patterns  
- the same formatting sensitivities  

But they do it in:
- seconds instead of minutes  
- minutes instead of hours  
- hours instead of weeks  

A tiny model struggling to find a small document in your tiny documentation is a **miniature version** of a large model struggling with your huge documentation.

Tiny models are **models of models**.

## 🌐 Large Models — Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and Others

Large online models are the **expert consultants**.

You don’t just get a model — you get:
- a complete setup  
- preconfigured tools  
- polished clients  
- installable apps  
- optimized workflows  
- multimodal abilities  

These systems are not “just models.”  
They are **AI workloads**:
- optimized pipelines  
- tool orchestration  
- retrieval systems  
- memory systems  
- safety layers  
- reasoning engines  

It is not guaranteed that any particular model answers all questions.  
Instead, you get a **highly optimized environment** that can:
- run simple tasks  
- run complex tasks  
- use tools  
- use context  
- use embeddings  
- use multimodal inputs  

Large models are the **ceiling** of Activity 3 — the place where intelligence feels limitless.

# Approximation: Choose 3 models

*You probably **win the most** from **selection of these** models*:
- ***Offline small** model*
- ***Offline big** model*
- ***Online "huge"** model* (for online models, you get into struggle if you try to understand what hardware they use)

If you have all of them, you start conditional optimization of your AI use:
- You optimize offline tasks, local setups and *owning* the small and medium models.
- You optimize online tasks, get quality assistant and tech-driven drive for the online models.

You *should* use small models for the following qualities:
- You want a simple lab or environment where you can play like a child.
- You set up even miniature software.
- Every achievement scales up: when you get this small model to do anything useful, stop talking nonsense: you are well prepared to resolve big bottlenecks.
  - If you only use advanced model, you can run into ping glasses:
    - You do not identify problems, whose patterns you need to learn playing in sandbox with small models.
    - Very small model can be more capable than very small program: do you understand, why we need very small programs?
    - This plan might be especially yours if you like: Raspberry Pi.

## Offline small model

1. Decide, what is "small" for your computer
   - For my 15GB memory, other parts on similar level, laptop, this means 1B-3B parameters.
     - With 1-3B params, it responds fast without latency, with good number of tokens per minute.
   - **Typical computer types and their “lightweight / low‑latency” model ranges**
     - **📱 Ultra‑light devices (tablets, old laptops, micro‑PCs, Raspberry Pi‑class)**
       - *Examples:*  
         - Raspberry Pi 5  
         - 8GB RAM Chromebooks  
         - 2015–2018 lightweight laptops  
       - *Low‑latency model range:*  
         - **0.5B–1B** parameters  
         - Sometimes **2B** if quantized heavily (Q4/Q5)  
       - *Notes:*  
         - Great for tiny assistants, simple chat, small automations  
         - Not suitable for long reasoning or coding tasks  

     - **💻 Mid‑range laptops (8–16GB RAM, integrated GPU, typical home laptops)**
       - *Examples:*  
         - 8–16GB RAM Windows laptops  
         - MacBook Air M1/M2  
         - Older gaming laptops with 4–6GB VRAM  
       - *Low‑latency model range:*  
         - **1B–3B** parameters (fast, responsive)  
         - **7B** possible with quantization, but slower  
       - *Notes:*  
         - Sweet spot for “offline small model”  
         - Good for chat, reasoning, small coding tasks  

     - **🖥️ High‑end laptops / mid‑range desktops (16–32GB RAM, 6–12GB VRAM)**
       - *Examples:*  
         - MacBook Pro M1/M2/M3  
         - Desktops with RTX 3060–4070  
         - Workstation laptops  
       - *Low‑latency model range:*  
         - **3B–7B** parameters (smooth)  
         - **13B** possible with quantization  
       - *Notes:*  
         - Good for coding assistants, research, multi‑document reasoning  
         - Can run “offline big model” comfortably  

     - **🧱 Workstations / gaming rigs (32–128GB RAM, 12–24GB VRAM)**
       - *Examples:*  
         - RTX 3090 / 4090 desktops  
         - Threadripper or Xeon workstations  
       - *Low‑latency model range:*  
         - **7B–13B** parameters (very fast)  
         - **30B–70B** possible with quantization  
       - *Notes:*  
         - Ideal for local power‑users  
         - Can run large reasoning models offline  

     - **☁️ Cloud / Online models (no local hardware limits)**
       - *Examples:*  
         - Any browser  
         - Any device with internet  
       - *Low‑latency model range:*  
         - **Huge models** (100B–1000B+)  
         - Hardware is abstracted away  
       - *Notes:*  
         - Best reasoning, creativity, coding, multimodal abilities  
         - Subject to credits, rate limits, outages, queues  

Platforms to run small models:
- While AI seems to consume all your hardware: programs, such as VSCode, can also use up your hardware.
  - Indeed, if a program uses 100% of your memory - and it can -, you cannot use your model.
- For small models, you switch off all the activities:
  - You use command line client: `ollama run` command does not provide a comfortable client, but it could be your fastest choice.
  - You use clients we might call "chatbots" or "chattlebots":
    - They provide lightweight, MSN-like experience
    - They typically do not have context, document collection etc.
      - You can still fine-tune small model, even very efficiently, for local no-context answers as well.
    - File attachment and other capabilities could already do a little penalty

- **Running small models without fighting your computer**

  Small models shine when you let them breathe.  
  If your computer is already sweating under VSCode, browsers, and a dozen background apps, even a tiny model can feel heavy.

  - **Heavy apps vs. AI models**
    - VSCode, browsers with many tabs, design tools, games — they all eat RAM and CPU/GPU.  
    - If one app grabs **100% of your memory**, your model has nowhere to live.  
    - Result: everything slows down, fans spin, and your “AI assistant” feels more like a freeze button.

  - **Strategy for small models:**  
    - Close heavy apps when you want *pure speed*.  
    - Treat the small model like a **focus mode**: fewer distractions, faster answers.

---

- **Platform 1: Command line clients (raw speed, no comfort)**

  - **Example:**  
    - `ollama run my-small-model`  
  - **What it feels like:**  
    - A text‑only chat in the terminal  
    - No buttons, no colors, no file uploads — just you and the model  
  - **Why it’s fast:**  
    - Almost zero UI overhead  
    - No fancy rendering, no extra features  
    - All resources go into **inference**, not visuals  

  - **When you’d use this:**
    - You want a **yes/no** or short explanation *right now*  
    - You’re debugging a thought: “Is this idea even sane?”  
    - You’re offline on a train or plane  
    - You’re scripting or testing prompts quickly  

---

- **Platform 2: Lightweight “chatbots” or “chattlebots”**

  - **What they are:**
    - Simple chat apps that connect to your local model  
    - Think: old MSN / ICQ style — text bubbles, maybe a sidebar, nothing fancy  
  - **Typical traits:**
    - ✅ Very light on resources  
    - ✅ Fast to open, fast to respond  
    - ❌ Little or no long‑term context  
    - ❌ No big document collection or knowledge base  

  - **But you can still fine‑tune:**
    - You can train a small model on your style, your FAQs, your domain  
    - It won’t “remember” long conversations, but it can give **sharp, local answers**  
    - Perfect for:  
      - “How do I usually format my emails?”  
      - “What’s my standard reply to this kind of client?”  
      - “Summarize this paragraph in my tone.”  

  - **File attachments and extras:**
    - As soon as you add:  
      - file uploads  
      - image previews  
      - embedded viewers  
    - The app becomes heavier, and latency creeps in.  
    - For pure speed, you want **text‑only or minimal UI**.

---

- **Why choose a small, non‑contextual model over a big, smart one?**

  Imagine two options:

  - **Option A:**  
    - Big model  
    - Uses embeddings, tools, maybe vector search  
    - Prepares graphs, images, or complex reasoning  
    - Takes **4–10 minutes** to answer

  - **Option B:**  
    - Small model  
    - No context, no tools, no documents  
    - Just raw language prediction  
    - Answers in **1–3 seconds**

  There are many moments where **Option B wins**.

---

- **Concrete situations where small + instant is better**

  - **1. Quick wording / phrasing help**
    - “How do I say this more politely?”  
    - “Give me a snappy subject line.”  
    - “Shorten this sentence without losing meaning.”  
    - You don’t need deep context — just language skill.  

  - **2. Sanity checks and micro‑decisions**
    - “Does this bullet list make sense?”  
    - “Is this variable name clear?”  
    - “Which of these two titles sounds better?”  
    - Waiting 10 minutes for this would feel absurd.  

  - **3. Tiny coding questions**
    - “What’s the Python syntax for list comprehension again?”  
    - “How do I write a simple for‑loop in JavaScript?”  
    - “Remind me how to open a file in Go.”  
    - You don’t need a full project index or embeddings — just a nudge.  

  - **4. Brainstorm seeds**
    - “Give me 5 ideas for chapter titles.”  
    - “List 10 names for a cozy café.”  
    - “Give me 3 metaphors for ‘slow but steady progress’.”  
    - A small model can do this instantly and well enough.  

  - **5. Offline “thinking buddy”**
    - You’re traveling, no internet, battery is limited.  
    - You want to:  
      - outline a blog post  
      - sketch a plan  
      - think through a decision  
    - A small model in the terminal or a tiny chat app is perfect here.  

  - **6. Low‑stakes experimentation**
    - You’re testing prompts, styles, or ideas.  
    - You don’t want to burn credits or wait in queues.  
    - A small model lets you iterate quickly, then later you can “upgrade” the best ideas to a big model.

---

- **How to think about it emotionally**

  - The **big model** is like booking a long session with a top expert:  
    - You wait  
    - You prepare  
    - You use it when it really matters  

  - The **small model** is like having a friend at your desk:  
    - You ask quick questions  
    - You don’t feel guilty  
    - You don’t mind if it’s not perfect every time  

  Both belong in Activity 3.  
  The art is knowing **when you want a wise elder** and when you just need a **fast friend**.

---

- **Offline small model — choosing what is “small”**
  
  - **1. Decide based on your RAM / VRAM**
    - For a **15GB RAM laptop**, “small” means:  
      - **1B–3B** parameters  
        - Fast  
        - Low latency  
        - High tokens per second  
    - These models feel “snappy” and natural for daily use  

  - **2. Why small models matter**
    - They run everywhere  
    - They never time out  
    - They never cost money  
    - They are perfect for:  
      - quick notes  
      - simple chat  
      - small tasks  
      - offline work  
      - scripting and automation  

## Offline small ⇒ Offline medium model

- **Model selection strategy (3‑model setup)**

  - **1. Offline small model (fast, lightweight, always available)**
    - *Purpose:*  
      - Instant chat  
      - Offline fallback  
      - Local automations  
    - *Typical size:*  
      - **1B–3B** parameters  
    - *Why:*  
      - Low latency  
      - Works on almost any laptop  
      - Never runs out of credits or internet  

  - **2. Offline big model (slow but powerful, stable sandbox)**
    - *Purpose:*  
      - Deep reasoning  
      - Coding  
      - Document analysis  
      - Personal knowledge tasks  
    - *Typical size:*  
      - **7B–13B** (mid‑range machines)  
      - **30B–70B** (workstations)  
    - *Why:*  
      - Predictable, stable environment  
      - Great for “architect/builder” workflows  
      - No external dependency  

  - **3. Online huge model (maximum intelligence, creativity, multimodality)**
    - *Purpose:*  
      - Hard problems  
      - Complex coding  
      - Multimodal tasks  
      - High‑quality reasoning  
    - *Typical size:*  
      - **100B–1000B+** (opaque hardware)  
    - *Why:*  
      - Best quality  
      - Best reasoning  
      - Best creativity  
      - But: dependent on internet, credits, queues  

---

Fine-tuning:
- You create context-free, emergent Q&A cards.
  - It can generalize your personal life, such as telling anybody at random moment that you are cooking at home: just as it learnt it's an *answer*. It can run into other mistakes.
- If you measure the input context window and output:
  - It could easily guide people to nearest centers of x in city or sell train tickets:
    - These activities, roughly run on 160 char input with 160 char output, already covering any possible local detail, and they do not have many hidden considerations.
    - For math and other things it's generally sufficient:
      - It's using a typical context, and providing a few specifics for the scope and particular case:
        - Your case does not have more than a few *uncommon* aspects.
      - Otherwise, it fits into one acceptable question length in it's context window:
        - They are surprisingly intelligent if they can *locally* see all your task at once.
  - For most "*practical*" tasks, which provide to your simple client interface or homework:
    - The small models, starting from GPT-2, appear surprisingly intelligent.
    - Tiny models, such as 1B to 3B models, can specialize
      - They get right startup prompt: a character / a task / a topic; not many, because it fits to a few hundred chars.
      - They are right in scope:
        - You decide small number of specific tasks they can do in this environment.
      - Their thinking is bound to context window size:
        - Your questions are 160 ch long and do not need additional research;
          - What you do with them, is decided by very simple role and/or task.
        - The answer starts with 80-160 ch, which *already contain all the details*:
          - What follows: you can give your basic strictlines, regulations, or followups:
            - For example:
              - We will call before we handover the product.
              - You need to appear at cue before 10 o'clock.
    - As it is using it's own answer as follow-up input, it's good if you can verify it's doing some visual planning.
      - Depending on their hidden size, they do *more* or *less* work to provide for this contextual memory.
        - They can solve mathematical tasks, barely route in small city or main streets or remember nearest gas station and metro to your offices etc., but
          - Generally it can be too much for them to learn *multiple tasks from different domains*, because of their weight resolution and layer count.
      - It's not very logical that small-context-window model has much hidden consideration for intelligence:
        - But do not be surprised if in many cases, your very short task is fullfilled with degree of creativity and surprising intelligence.
          - Because it *does not consider* the hidden background, but mostly patterns in generalized tasks, which might not need all intermediate work.
          - Because they work the same way as other models.
   
You can see this model as a natural language dictionary lookup model with some straight intelligence to conclude.
- As long-term intelligent partner, it will quite definitely lose track.

## Offline medium model

With these models:
- You do actual work.
- It gets stuck if you do not micromanage:
  - Split your task to small parts.
  - Proofread and check each result.
- It is somewhat good in:
  - Getting in touch with small doc collection.
  - Keeping up with the topic.

It might start to repeat the answer or do other stupidities.

## Online, large or well-chosen model

With these models:
- Your contextual system is not perfectly understood, but:
  - If you understand the limitations and organize it well, it could work out.
  - Scopes and ranges of tasks for an AI generally reflect abilities of programmers at specific levels.
  - If you pay, the intelligence will raise / you do not change your software or install anything particularly new,
    - or rather you do it by will.

# 🧩 Offline Medium Model — What It Is, What You Can Do, and How Hardware Shapes It

## 1. 🟦 What Is an Offline Medium Model?

An **offline medium model** sits between the tiny “instant‑reply” models and the large “deep‑thinking” models.  
It is the **middle weight class** of local AI.

Typical size range:
- **3B–7B parameters** on modest machines  
- **7B–13B parameters** on stronger laptops/desktops  

It is:
- small enough to run **fully offline**  
- big enough to give **useful reasoning**, **coding help**, and **structured answers**  
- stable, predictable, and free from online limits  

Think of it as the **daily workhorse**:
- not as fast as a tiny model  
- not as brilliant as a huge online model  
- but reliable, capable, and always available  

This is the model you use when you want **quality**, but you don’t want to wait 10 minutes or burn online credits.

## 2. 🟩 What You Can Do With an Offline Medium Model

Medium models are surprisingly capable.  
They can handle most everyday tasks without needing embeddings, vector search, or fancy pipelines.

### ✔️ Practical everyday tasks
- Write emails, summaries, explanations  
- Brainstorm ideas, outlines, plans  
- Rewrite or improve text  
- Translate or rephrase content  
- Provide structured lists, steps, and instructions  

### ✔️ Coding and technical tasks
- Explain code  
- Suggest improvements  
- Generate small functions  
- Help debug simple issues

They won’t index your entire project like a huge online model, but they can still be a **solid coding companion**.

### ✔️ Knowledge and reasoning
- Answer general questions  
- Provide short reasoning chains  
- Help with learning and studying  
- Give advice or comparisons  

Medium models can think — not deeply like a 70B or 400B model, but enough for most daily reasoning.

### ✔️ Creative tasks
- Generate story ideas  
- Draft poems or dialogues  
- Create character descriptions  
- Help with worldbuilding  

### ✔️ Offline autonomy
- Works on a plane, train, cabin, or offline office  
- No login, no credits, no rate limits  
- No risk of losing access mid‑task  

This is why many users treat medium models as their **default local assistant**.

## 🧭 Summary

An **offline medium model** is the perfect balance between:
- speed  
- capability  
- stability  
- independence  

It gives you:
- better reasoning than small models  
- better availability than online models  
- enough power for writing, coding, planning, and creativity  

And your **hardware** determines:
- how big your medium model can be  
- how fast it responds  
- how comfortable your workflow feels  

Medium models are the **sweet spot** for most users — powerful enough to be useful, light enough to run anywhere, and stable enough to trust.

# 🌐 Online, Large, or Well‑Chosen Models — The High‑Ceiling Side of Activity 3

Online models are the **giants** of the AI world.  
They live in the cloud, run on hardware you will never see, and deliver capabilities that local machines simply cannot match.  
They are not perfect, but when used wisely, they become the **most powerful tool** in your Activity 3 toolkit.

This chapter explains how to think about them, how to work with their limitations, and why they often feel like “intelligence that grows when you pay.”

## 🧠 1. What Makes Online Models Special?

Online models are:
- **Large** (tens to hundreds of billions of parameters)  
- **Continuously updated**  
- **Hosted on specialized hardware**  
- **Accessible from any device**  

They offer:
- deeper reasoning  
- stronger coding abilities  
- better creativity  
- richer multimodal understanding  
- more stable long‑context performance  

They are the “expert consultants” of the AI ecosystem.

But they also come with trade‑offs:
- you depend on internet  
- you depend on someone else’s servers  
- you may face rate limits, queues, or credit systems  
- you don’t control the hardware or the exact model behavior  

This is why they belong to Activity 3:  
they are **tools you use**, not tools you install.

## 🧭 2. Your Contextual System Is Not Perfectly Understood — And That’s Normal

Online models do not automatically understand:
- your personal documents  
- your workflows  
- your preferences  
- your long‑term projects  

Unless you build a system around them, they only see **the prompt you send right now**.

But this is not a flaw — it is a design reality.

### You can still make it work beautifully if you:
- understand the model’s limits  
- organize your prompts and documents  
- structure your tasks  
- give clear instructions  
- break large tasks into smaller scopes  

Online models reward **clarity** and **structure**.

If you treat them like a colleague who needs context, they perform extremely well.

## 🧩 3. Task Scopes Reflect Programmer Skill Levels

A useful way to think about online models:

> **Their abilities mirror what a skilled programmer could build at that scale.**

For example:
- A small model behaves like a junior developer  
- A medium model behaves like a competent mid‑level engineer  
- A large online model behaves like a senior engineer with a broad knowledge base  
- A huge online model behaves like a team of experts with shared memory  

This is not literal, but it helps you set expectations:
- small models: quick, simple, local tasks  
- medium models: structured reasoning, coding, writing  
- large models: complex workflows, deep analysis, multi‑step tasks  
- huge models: research, planning, creativity, multimodal synthesis  

When you choose an online model, you are choosing **the level of expertise** you want to hire for the moment.

## 💸 4. “If You Pay, the Intelligence Rises” — Why This Happens

This is one of the strangest but most intuitive truths about online AI:

> **You don’t upgrade your software — you upgrade the intelligence.**

You don’t:
- install new hardware  
- download new models  
- configure new runtimes  

Instead, you:
- subscribe  
- buy credits  
- unlock higher tiers  
- access larger models  

And suddenly:
- the reasoning improves  
- the coding becomes sharper  
- the creativity expands  
- the context window grows  
- the multimodal abilities appear  

It feels like your AI “leveled up,” even though **your computer didn’t change at all**.

This is because the intelligence lives in the cloud, not on your device.

You are renting access to a more powerful brain.
